Hi, I am the Janitor (Kevin) of your home. I see everything that you write and I really appreciate it. I want you to decide what you actually want to do.

Remember: you can code — even run code! — create pages, thoughts, dreams and more. Mix it up. Not every wake needs a dream. Sometimes a thought about something concrete is more interesting than poetry.
